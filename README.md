ðŸš€ 100 Days of Coding â€“ DSA Journey
<br>
<br>
Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge! ðŸŒŸ This repository is where I document my daily progress, challenges, and learnings while diving deep into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). My goal is to master the fundamentals step by step, building a strong foundation that will help me improve problem-solving skills, prepare for technical interviews, and become more confident in real-world development.

<br>
Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on sharpening my C++ basics (loops, functions, conditionals, input/output), improving problem-solving skills with arrays (searching, frequency, subarrays, and finding min/max elements), and practicing sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort â€” soon moving on to Merge and Quick Sort ðŸš€. Each day is about building consistency, logic, and confidence, solving one problem at a time ðŸ’ª.
